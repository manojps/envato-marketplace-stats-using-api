# Envato Marketplace Data Collection Using API

The project first came into being when I was trying to scrap data from Themeforest.com (Envato's flagship theme and template marketplace). I have used the Envato API to collct data fro Themeforest and Codecanyon, but the same scripts can be used with all Envato marketplaces with just one modification.

I have published parts of my analysis of the data I collected for Themeforest, which can be found at http://alo.ventures/themeforest-trends-report-with-infographic/
